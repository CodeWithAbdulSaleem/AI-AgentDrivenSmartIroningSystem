# AI-AgentDrivenSmartIroningSystem
An edge-AI based smart ironing solution that autonomously senses temperature, humidity, and fabric contact to prevent overheating, fabric burns, and shine marks. The system adapts ironing behavior for new or untrained operators by estimating ironing speed and dynamically regulating heat and safety actions in real time using an ESP32.
